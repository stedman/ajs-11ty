<div class="ajs-box">
We're not in our usual location! We'll be meeting at <strong>Spredfast</strong> this month in the Silicon Labs building, so please plan accordingly.

Hey Austin JavaScripters, summer is in full swing and `{% raw %}{{ joke_about_how_ember_is_hot }}{% endraw %}`. We're excited to hear from [Iheanyi Ekechukwu][] as he tells us about "Ember.js, Ember-CLI, and how it all relates to that 'shut up and dance with me' song," (which we were actually [hoping to hear about][] last month). Hope to see you there this Tuesday, <x-date>{{ page.when | date_to_xmlschema }}</x-date>.
