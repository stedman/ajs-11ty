We've got another `~*super rad*~` meetup next Tuesday, October 21<sup>st</sup>. Local favorite [Dan DeFelippi][1] ([@expertdan][2]) is going to educate us on building mobile apps with [Cordova][3] (the open-source engine behind [PhoneGap][4]). Aside from being a proper geek and hacker, Dan is a co-founder of local bike rental and bike share app [Spokefly][5].
