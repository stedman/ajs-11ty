It's April, so let's shake off our collective SXSW hangovers üçª (or maybe emerge from our SXSW bunkers ‚ò¢Ô∏è) and get together on {{ when | date: '%B %e, %Y' }} for another great AustinJS!

We'll be hearing from Anton Astashov about [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), a transpiled-to-JavaScript language which makes sure you‚Äôll never have a runtime error in your app. Almost. He'll cover why it‚Äôs cool, what it looks like, it‚Äôs pros and (most importantly) cons!
