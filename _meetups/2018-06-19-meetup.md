Who is ready to optimize your user's spa experience? Anton is going to tell us the secrets to making your visitors feel pampered in no time flat! Anton will share all the tricks of the trade, from how to improve time to first relaxation to HTTP/2 aromatherapy tips.

Anton has recently been working on optimizing performance for mixbook.com, and heâ€™d like to tell y'all about their experience: what worked and what didn't.

Topics include,

* how they got rid of all external CSS to avoid blocking network calls
* how they started inlining some server-side data right into JS bundles and rebuilt/redeployed the app automatically when that data changes
* how we used webpack with custom loaders to automate all that stuff
* and more and more :)
