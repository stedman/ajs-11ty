Sup, y'all. We've got something special planned for our July meetup and we are _shore_ you're gonna think it's fresh to death.

Here's [the Situation][the-situation]: AustinJS is going down the Shore! Jenn Schiffer is staging a blowout [JerseyScript][jerseyscript] bo-coup on {{ when | date: '%B %e, %Y' }}. Jenn has convinced New York's own Adam J. Sontag to come rap with us about a speech recognition game he is working on.
