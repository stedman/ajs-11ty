[Appcelerator][1], the company behind the awesome mobile app development framework [Titanium][2], has been a long time supporter of Austin JS going back many years.  This month, we are treated to a special presentation (no, NOT a product pitch) by one of their key (and local!) developers, [Bert Granges][3], to talk about and show off the latest and greatest that Titanium has to offer.

Ever wonder what it would be like to use JavaScript to build native applications for iOS and Android? Wouldn't it be nice if you could use one codebase for both platforms?  Using JavaScript, Appcelerator Titanium platform and Cloud Services, you'll walk through what it takes to build out a fully functional mobile application supported by backend services. Along the way you will learn how Appcelerator Titanium works and hopefully learn a bit about JavaScript along the way.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][4].
