Glad tidings, Austin JavaScripters, we bring you good news of our meetup this month! We're happy to welcome Kassandra Perch to throw down some knowledge on Twitter's framework, [Flight][1].

Her talk is titled "Flight: a Framework done right,” and we'll talk about how the framework is event-driven, component-based, and leverages the DOM to form a cohesive code structure. The concept of functional mixins will also be introduced, and how it is unique from other forms of class composition. Finally, we'll cover how all of these create a testable, scalable, friendly front-end code base.
