It's hot.  We know. Why not come down to this month's meetup and learn some cool things from local front-end expert and O'Reilly published author, [Garann Means][1]!

If you know much about the engineering side of Etsy, you're probably aware that they love their devtools there. [StatsD][4] is one of their better-known tools. It's an open source Node service that they use to collect statistics about how the site is working and being used. Garann will talk about the tool itself and about how it fits into Etsy's larger process.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][5].
