    bio: Tara is an independent front end developer who cares a lot about Internet freedom and building free and open-source tools that help users secure their online communications. She thinks the Axolotl ratchet protocol (used by TextSecure, Signal, and WhatsApp) is especially neat, and will gladly chat your ear off about it.

Are you finally recovered from SXSW and ready. for. some. JavaScript?! Well, you're in luck: this Tuesday, Austin local [Tara Vancil](https://twitter.com/tbvancil)Â is giving us a clinic on JavaScript crypto. Please don't tell the NSA.

The web hosts a large portion of the world's new cryptographic tools, and the debate about whether JavaScript is up to the challenge carries on. Tara will discuss how JavaScript plays an important role in developing some of the best crypto tools out there, explain some situations in which it just doesn't cut it, and show some examples of both.
