Wrapping up the amazing conference that was [TXJS][1], this month TXJS frontman, [Alex Sexton][2] will be hosting June's meetup. We also have Austin local via Chicago, [Tim Tyrrell][3] chatting up [Jasmine][4], the uber-cool JavaScript unit testing framework.

There seems to be a tendency for developers to do an excellent job of unit testing their server-side code but leaving client-side javascript as the new “spaghetti” dumping ground and it doesn’t have to be that way! Jasmine is a nifty Javascript BDD testing framework with a RSpec-like syntax that easily integrates with vanilla JavaScript, jQuery plugins, and even Rails applications.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions. This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner.
