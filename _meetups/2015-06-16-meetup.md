Howdy, Texas. We&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing all of you fine vaqueras and vaqueros this Tuesday <x-date>{{ page.when | date_to_xmlschema }}</x-date> as Kyle Simpson ([@getify][]) rustles up some knowledge on transpiling JavaScript.

The new reality of JavaScript is that the features will evolve even quicker than the specification, and much quicker than your &ldquo;supported&rdquo; browsers. So we&rsquo;re going to have to come to grips with transpilers being a standard part of our build processes. But what can we do to wrangle at least two versions of every file? What does that mean for server-side coding (node/iojs) and what does it mean for browser-delivered files? Should we use the transpiled code everywhere, or should we have split delivery?
