After another [stellar SXSW event][1], Austin JS is back with another guest speaker, this time with [Ben Combee][2] of WebOS fame.

Straightforward and to the point, Ben will be chatting with us on how to build web apps with [Enyo][3] and [Onyx][4].

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][5].
