Happy New Year, Austin JavaScriptorians! Hopefully you're enjoying your 2014 SO MUCH you've already broken those pesky resolutions you made a couple of weeks ago.

We're kicking the new year off with an exciting talk from our friends at PayPal called "Release the Kraken: A Story of Node.js in the Enterprise." Jeff Harrell and Erik Toth will tell us how PayPal revitalized its tech stack by moving from Java, JSP, and proprietary solutions to a Node.js web application stack with [dust.js][1] templating. Developer agility was the primary motivation, but along the way they had to take on enterprise culture and teach people that JavaScript is no longer a "toy," but a powerful tool to wield. We'll also take a look at PayPal's web app framework, [Kraken][2].
