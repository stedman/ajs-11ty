> **We're not in our usual location!**: We'll be meeting at [TechSpace Austin](https://www.techspace.com/spaces/austin/cbd/) this month ([map](http://maps.google.com/?q=98%20San%20Jacinto%20Blvd.%20Austin,%20TX,%2078701)).

We've got a special meetup tonight! [Austin on Rails](http://www.austinonrails.org/), AustinJS, and [EmberATX](http://www.meetup.com/Ember-ATX/) are teaming up to bring [Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/) to town. Yehuda will tell us about "Ember, Now and Next," and then we'll have a Fireside Chat. Register and find out more on the event page:
