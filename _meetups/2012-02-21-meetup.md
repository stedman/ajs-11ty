Following up on last month's stellar presentation by [Nodejitsu][1]'s, co-founder and CTO, [Paolo Fragemeni][2], Austin JavaScript is back in February with another mover and shaker in the JavaScript and Mobile development industry, [Rebecca Murphey][3].

Rebecca will be introducing us to Toura's Mulberry, which is an open-source, cross-platform mobile application development framework built on top of [PhoneGap][8] that lets you use web technologies to produce engaging, content-rich applications. In this talk, Rebecca will give a quick demo of Mulberry basics, then dive in to how they architected the JavaScript, templates, CSS, and tests to create a flexible, pluggable, 100% client-side content publishing system. DON'T SLEEP ON THIS!

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][9].

Finally, we will be throwing the **3rd Annual Austin JS SXSW Party** in March so if you and/or your employer/company would like to sponsor the event (or be a part of it), please reach out to [@joemccann][9] to find out more details.
