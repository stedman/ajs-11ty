Whatup jorbascrupmers. As promised we're going to be hearing about a shiny new feature coming in the next version of JavaScript &mdash; generators.

[Jonathan Lipps][1] will give a talk titled _Yield! How ES6 Generators and Monocle-js Can Bring Async Into Line, Literally_, and will teach us how generators can save our souls from callback hell.
