Let's ring in the new year with some new JavaScript Hotness. We've got two JavaScript pros flying in from Mozilla to go over some cool new browser features!

Their talk will be about all the brand new stuff in the browser world. They describe it:

> It is no secret that Mozilla has been pushing the boundaries of what the internet is capable of, and has been a fundamental force in evolving the web. This will be a whirlwind tour of exciting JavaScript API's that Mozilla is leading.
>
> They are going to cover a variety of things; Web SMS, Web Telephony, Battery API, Web Vibrator, Touch, Camera, The future of gaming, Mouse Lock, Gamepad API, Gladius.js, Mozilla Open Web apps and Identity/Browser Id. Afterwards there will be a Q & A session covering these topics.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][1]. Alternatively you can heckle new host, [@slexaxton][2]!
