Why do some people hate JavaScript while others bask in its glory? In [Stack Overflow's 2018 Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/) of over 100,000 developers; JavaScript, HTML, and CSS rank as the _top three_ most used technologies, with 70% of developers stating that they use JavaScript. Next in the list is SQL with 57%.

Not everyone is an expert front-end developer, but it seems that most people at least have to dip their toes.

If you hate JavaScript, I'm going to _finally_ articulate why you _know in your heart_ that this is such a terrible language. For you JavaScript lovers out there, hopefully this sheds some light on why your language of choice is such a steaming pile of ðŸ’©.

Let's talk about what we can do about it.
