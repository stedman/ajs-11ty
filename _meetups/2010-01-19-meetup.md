    bio: Kyle Simpson is a UI architect from Austin, TX. He is passionate about user experience, specifically optimizing the UI to be as responsive, efficient, secure, and scalable as possible. He considers JavaScript the ultimate language and is constantly tinkering with how to push it further. If something can't be done in JavaScript or web technology, he's bored by it. He has a number of open-source projects, including flXHR, LABjs, mpAjax, and jXHR, and he also is a core contributor to SWFObject.Â Check him out at <a href="http://blog.getify.com">Getify</a>.

2010 is off to a ridiculous start for the JavaScript community and this month, we have TWO incredible topics and two renowned and respected speakers: Alex Sexton and Kyle Simpson.

## Superclassy Inheritance with JavaScript

Superclassy Inheritance with JavaScript is a quick look at the benefits and consequences of several inheritance patterns in JavaScript. Code reuse plays a major role in the DRY development pattern and leveraging the inheritance patterns built into JavaScript or manipulating them can change the way you build and organize large applications. Unfortunately, JavaScript's reputation and odd naming scheme have stopped people from using all the features that it has to offer. First, we'll discuss the array of options that exist and then go through a real-world example while using our newly honed inheritance-foo to make it play nice.

## Web Performance and JavaScript UI Architecture

Kyle will cover a couple of recent endeavors of mine into improving page- load performance on web sites. One is a set of experiments in various ways to deliver JavaScript code to the browser but to defer its execution until later. Such techniques are particularly well suited to mobile applications, but have some benefit to traditional browser apps as well. The other endeavor is a new site/service just launched at http://2static.it -- a service to provide free sub-domain aliases to create a cookie-free URL to load your static page assets (JS, CSS, images, SWFs, etc).

As time permits, Kyle will also give an intro/preview to both my upcoming talk at Developer-Day Austin and my upcoming talk at SXSW Interactive, on JavaScript UI Architecture. We'll cover a new theory/approach to UI architecture I'm calling CVC (Client-View-Controller), which is a deconstructed variation on the more common MVC pattern. It involves a simple template engine (written in JavaScript) which can run either on the server or in the browser, as well as several JavaScript based "controller" modules.
