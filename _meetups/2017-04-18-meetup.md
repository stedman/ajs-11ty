    bio: Mark hails from Irving, Texas. He's an architect at <a href="https://twitter.com/projekt202">@projekt202</a>, and when he's not judiciously driving for a high level of quality in his JavaScript based applications, you might find him dad'ing, playing guitar, or woodworking.

What up team we got a meetup tonight! Tonight we're going to talk about testing your code. We figured it's been [almost 6 years](/june-meetup-details-announced/) since we last talked about TDD, which means the ecosystem has been through ~11 different testing frameworks, so we might as well get back into the subject since QUALITY IS EVERYONE'S JOB ZERO.

[Mark Sims](https://twitter.com/markedwardsims) is coming to town to tell us about his experiences with testing and walk us through testing an app called Deathmatch that needs to be sure _Chuck always wins_.
