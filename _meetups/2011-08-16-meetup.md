    bio: Mike Cravey, a UI Engineer at <a href="http://whalesharkmedia.com">WhaleShark Media</a>, has loads of web development experience on the back and the front end.  Sadly, his biggest claim to fame is that he hired Joe McCann a few years back.  What you may not also know is that he has led some internal talks on the basics and fundamentals of JavaScript and his preferred library, jQuery.

After last month's massive turnout, it is officially clear that the only way to beat the Austin heat is to come to the Austin JavaScript meetup (duh).  With that being said, we are expecting all of you to return for this month's installment of the meetup as we have local living legend, [Mike Cravey][1], here to serve up the fundamentals of JavaScript and jQuery.

Mike's talk will focus on the fundamentals of JavaScript the language.  Think you know it all?  We guarantee you will learn something new, unless you are [@andrewdupont][4] BECAUSE HE KNOWS ALL [#dupontCAPS][5].  Moreover, the introductory talk with cover things like function hoisting and closures, but even simpler topics like basic expressions.  Noobs are certainly welcome so if you are one or know someone, be sure they attend.  The presentation will be a quick one, so feel free to chime in while Cravey runs the show.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions. This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner.

Since [Joe][3] is still on gypsy status, [Alex Sexton][6] will be hosting the meetup again!
