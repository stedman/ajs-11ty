For the month of March, instead of discussing closures and anonymous functions, the Austin JavaScript meetup group will be holding a party during [SXSWi][1] at [Kung Fu Saloon](http://www.kungfusaloon.com) sponsored by [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com).  We will have FREE BEER, FREE FOOD, AND FREE GAMES!  Yes, you read that right:FREE!  No strings attached!  Escape the mayhem on East 6th by foot or [pedicab][2] and end up at Kung Fu Saloon, West 6th's newest hangout, and play a round of Street Fighter II or skeeball while downing free, QUALITY (non-domestic) beer.

The event details are as follows:

* *Where:* Kung Fu Saloon - [510 Rio Grande Street Austin, TX 78701][3]
* *When:* Monday, March 15, 2010 from 4pm to 9pm.
* *Why:* Meet fellow techies and hackers from around the world.
* *How:* Just show up to Kung Fu Saloon!

From Kung Fu Saloon's website:

> Kung Fu Saloon is a West 6th Street area watering hole featuring a relaxed atmosphere in downtown Austin.  To satisfy your thirst we offer a full bar including 24 beers on tap, with a selection ranging from the everyman’s Miller Light to the Belgian man’s Chimay.  Oh yeah, we almost forgot to mention the specialty Sake bomb menu!
> Entertainment includes 14 vintage arcade games like Ms. Pacman, NBA Jam, Street Fighter II, Galaga,  Golden Tee, Space Invaders & more.  The fun continues with Shuffleboard, three original Skee Ball machines, and board games available for checkout at your table including Jenga, Boggle, Dominoes, & Giant Checkers.
> Reclaimed Chicago brick & 100 year old Texas barn wood keep it comfortable.   Random accents like Space Invaders with glowing candle lit eyes invading down the masonry and pixelated images of Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee keep it amusing.  Come check us out!

The Austin JavaScript SXSWi Happy Hour is graciously sponsored by none other than the huge supporter and innovator in the JavaScript world,  Appcelerator.  Appcelerator will be on site showcasing their premier development kit, [Titanium][4], which allows you to write native desktop and mobile (iPhone and Android with Blackberry right around the corner) applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and even Python, Ruby, and PHP).  The Appcelerator team will also be giving away loads of free swag including free t-shirts for the first 500 people!

And of course we'll have some food to wash all that beer down.  Austin's premier hot dog vendor, [Man Bites Dog][5], will be providing us with a "build-your-own-dog" gourmet hot dog buffet!

Additional sponsors and support provided by [subPrint Interactive][6] and [Virtue Group][7].
