Thanks to Logan Lindquist's work, the Austin JavaScript group now has a list you can subscribe to via email:

Just activate <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=Twitter/Austinjs" target="_blank">this link</a> to go straight to the email address entry form.  Enter your email address, then verify it in your inbox (a verification email will be sent automatically).

Thanks Logan!
