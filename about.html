      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Austin JavaScript is a community that meets to discuss JavaScript and the open web. The group started back in 2009, and it’s been going strong ever since. We cover a range of topics, including:</p>

        <li>The JavaScript language</li>
        <li>New features of the web platform</li>
        <li>JavaScript app frameworks</li>
        <li>Frontend ops</li>
        <li>Testing your code</li>
        <li>Running JavaScript in native apps</li>
        <li>Running JavaScript on the server</li>
        <li>Running JavaScript on other peoples sites</li>
        <li>Cryptography</li>
        <li>How CSS colors got their names</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’d like to get more details on past topics, take a look at the <a href="/post/">archives</a>.</p>

      <h2>How it usually works</h2>
      <p>We typically meet on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Tuesday of each month downtown. We’ll have a speaker or two, open things up for questions and discussion, and then head to a nearby watering hole to continue the festivities.</p>

      <h2>Excellence</h2>
      <p>We’ve work hard to build a community of people that treats each other with <em>excellence</em>. We’ve formalized what this means into our <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

        <h2>The Organizers</h2>
        <p>Austin JavaScript is made possible by the hard work and goodwill of many people, but there are a few in particular that you should feel free to reach out to if you’ve got any questions:</p>
      </div>
      {% for key, person in people %}
      {% if person.status == 'active' %}
      <div class="brick">
        {% include 'business-card.njk' %}
      </div>
      {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
    </div>
  </div>
