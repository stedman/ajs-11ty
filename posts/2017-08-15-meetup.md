Ever wonder how to pronounce Babel? Join us Tuesday <x-date>{{ site.categories.meetups[0].when | date_to_xmlschema }}</x-date> to find out! Austin's own Andrew Levine will teach us how to write Babel plugins.

### Talk summary

Andrew is going to give an intro to writing Babel plugins. He'll start with a very high level summary of how Babel works, and then dive into the Plugin APIs and several examples of real world plugins to write.
