Ever wonder how to pronounce Babel? Join us Tuesday {{ when | fullDate }} to find out! Austin's own Andrew Levine will teach us how to write Babel plugins.

## Talk summary

Andrew is going to give an intro to writing Babel plugins. He'll start with a very high level summary of how Babel works, and then dive into the Plugin APIs and several examples of real world plugins to write.
