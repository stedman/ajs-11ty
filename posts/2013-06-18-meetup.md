It's June. It's getting hot and we all need a little more JavaScript in our lives. Well, enjoy the air conditioned comfort of Austin JS on June 18th with a talk from JavaScript SuperStar Rebecca Murphey.

It's one thing to write the code you need to write to get something working; it's another thing to write the code you need to write if you want to be able to prove that it works — and that it keeps working as you refactor and add new features. In this talk, we'll look at what it means to write testable JavaScript code.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@slexaxton][9]!
