On the heels of the epic conference week that was [JSConf][1]and [Nodeconf][2], the Austin JS meetup is finally set for the the month of May.  We will be going over some of the highlights of JSConf and local JavaScript hacker and semi-pro [videographer][3], [Alex Sexton][4], will be giving a talk on what to expect out of [Modernizr 2.0][5]. We will also be giving away a ticket to [TXJS][6].  Seriously.

Modernizr was one of the first libraries on the scene in the &#8216;new-world feature testing religion.&#8217; Modernizr 2 is just around the corner and there are some nifty new features in there to help you build modern web apps. Some time would and will be well spent going into how to use Modernizr, but there will also be some more in depth looks into the internals of the core library, build tool, Modernizr.load and into how to extend all of these things for great good. HTML5 today. Straight up.

Did we mention we are giving away a ticket to [TXJS][10]?  It&#8217;s sold out, btw.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][12].
