This month's meetup we take a step away from the traditionally hardcore, engineering-focused styles talks and presentations and decide to focus back on the user interface and beautifying the web, specifically typography. Neighborhood superstar, Rails aficionado and iOS contemporary [Dave Rupert][1] will be discussing and showcasing, [Lettering.js][2].

Web type is exploding all over the web but CSS currently doesn't offer complete down-to-the-letter control. While working on the [Lost World's Fairs][3] project for Microsoft and the launch of IE9 Beta, Dave Rupert and team needed that level of control. Thus was born, Lettering.js, a jQuery plugin for radical web typography.

We'll be walking through this simple jQuery plugin line-by-line, talking about the art of releasing a jQuery plugin, and peeking at some real-world use cases.

Of course we will followup his presentation with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][5].
