Happy New Year!  Now that most of us are back to work after a hopefully relaxing holiday, we are ready to kick off yet another year of solid JavaScript meetups for the Austin area.

This month we have a special guest flying in from New York City — the CTO and co-founder of [Nodejitsu][1], [Paolo Fragemeni][2].  Paolo, a solid computer programmer and veteran hacker has written loads of node.js code including the a significant portion dedicated to the node.js framework, [Flatiron][3].

Node.js. What is it?!! How does it work?!! Paolo will be giving an informative talk on just that — the anatomy of node.js. So whether you are are node.js newbie or a seasoned veteran, this informative talk on node will benefit you.

Also, we will be throwing the **3rd Annual Austin JS SXSW Party** in March so if you and/or your employer/company would like to sponsor the event (or be a part of it), please reach out to [@joemccann][4] to find out more details.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][4].
