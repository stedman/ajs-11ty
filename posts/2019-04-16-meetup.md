Sometimes it's the little things that count - in 2s complement. Come hear about how to program the [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) microcontroller using [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/) and see some fancy rainbow animations on strips of [NeoPixels](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168).
