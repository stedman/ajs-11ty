Simon has been building browser based simulations such as [coldwar.io](https://coldwar.io) and [ratsofthemaze.com](https://ratsofthemaze.com) over the past few years, showcasing them at numerous JS Confs and our own TXJS. Since he's in town this week, he's going to give us a casual retrospective on this work and a dive into some of the code.

### Special Guest Host

Lon and Andrew are off to JSConf US and Aaron is taking a sabbatical to finish his upcoming definitive book on `ConcreteAbstractFactoryAdapterImplementations`, so [Rebecca Murphey](https://twitter.com/rmurphey) has graciously offered to come out of retirement and host this month's event.
