&#127881;&#127878; Happy New Year &#127878;&#127881; Hopefully 2016 finds all of you well, and hopefully you'll **_RESOLLLLVVVVE_** to make it out to AustinJS next week to hear Alex Sexton talk about "almost definitely client side security." We're pretty certain that means his three-hour deep dive on whether [Rey is a Kenobi](http://wil.to/_/whatno.gif) (hey as long as it's not [politics](https://twitter.com/slexaxton/status/419373720080105472), [religion](https://alexsexton.com/blog/2015/02/the-15-commandments-of-front-end-performance/), or [sex](https://twitter.com/SlexAxton/status/685163843564093440) right).
