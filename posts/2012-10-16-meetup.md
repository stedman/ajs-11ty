Post ACL weekend here in Austin, we will be having the last installment of Austin JS for 2012.  Sad Panda, indeed.  This month, we have another local JavaScript expert chatting up Windows 8!

Jonathan Hebert's talk will be about writing Windows Store Apps with JavaScript, including:

* How to use the Windows Runtime from JavaScript
* The WinJS libraries
* Async programming with promises
* Re-using your Windows Store App code in a browser
* Avoiding gotchas in the Windows Store App process

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][4].  Oh wait!  He Hebert's not gonna be there. Guess you Hebert'll have to heckle guest host, [@slexaxton][5]!
