Since the timing of the Thanksgiving holidays sadly interrupts Austin JavaScript's monthly meetup schedule, we decided to still get together instead of canceling the meetup entirely.

<a href="http://austinjavascript.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/thanksgiving.js-400x400.png" rel="lightbox[386]"><img class="size-full wp-image-389 alignnone" title="Thanksgiving.js" src="http://austinjavascript.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/thanksgiving.js-400x400.png" alt="Thanksgiving.js" width="400" height="400" /></a>

So come and join us for **free beer**, **free food** and an all around good time at our staple pub, [The Ginger Man][1]. Â This is purely a social event, but your JS skills may be tested so come prepared!
