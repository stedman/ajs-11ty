After an off month in October, we are back this month with another local giving a great talk on how to use web technologies to build native mobile applications with libraries such as Sencha Touch and Phonegap.

Lyle will be discussing the creation of native mobile apps using web technologies.  He'll cover items from development to debugging and distribution of the app. To help demonstrate these concepts, he'll be demoing a recent app that he created called [Dateventure][2].

[Joe][4] is yet again still out of town so [Alex][5] will be guest hosting the meetup.
