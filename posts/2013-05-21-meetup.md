We&#8217;re back from SXSW and TXJS and ready to get back into action! This month we&#8217;ll have local JavaScripter, [Mark DiMarco][1] talk about [D3.js][2] and Data Visualizations.

Mark will give an intro to D3.js and data visualizations as well as some real world use cases for using these tools. Using an interactive programming style, he will navigate the ins and outs of simplifying data, manipulating it, and displaying it in a way that the end user can understand. He&#8217;ll compare D3 to some other popular charting libraries and note the reasons when you&#8217;d pick one style of data visualizations over another.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@slexaxton][4] or this months fill-in host [@tswicegood][5]!
