[Hold on to your butts][1], it&#8217;s AustinJS time. Not only will we hear from local hero Charles Lowell ([@cowboyd][2]) about &#8220;The Power of M,&#8221; but we&#8217;re also hosting a special guest from Google that will tell us about the future of the web platform, web components!

Whether you&#8217;re using a full fledged MVC framework. or just spicing up your UX with a single special interaction, it&#8217;s the &#8220;M&#8221; and only the &#8220;M&#8221; that is the key creating powerful user experiences. To demonstrate this principle in action, we&#8217;ll first create an in-memory model of what a color is, and then use it to build an interactive 3D color chooser. Sound hard? Not when we harness the Power of M. In this talk, we&#8217;ll track the building of an interactive, 3D color chooser that contains interactive visualizations of both the RGB Space (a cube), and the HSL Space (a cylinder).

**BUT WAIT THERE&#8217;S MORE!** Web components are an important part of the future of the web, so when we heard that Rob Dodson ([@rob_dodson][4]) was going to be in town, we invited him to come tell us more about them. Rob is a Google developer advocate that specializes in this area, so we&#8217;re looking forward to learning from him about web components and Google&#8217;s polyfill/framework [Polymer][5].
