After last month's huge turnout for the meetup we are expecting yet another large turnout for local software developer and JavaScript aficionado, [David Tulig][1].

David's talk will start by going over the components of the Google Closure Tools. This will cover the templates, which are usable on both the client and server, the library, which comes with a dependency management system and a large set of utilities, and the compiler, which performs advanced optimizations to speed up your JavaScript and reduce the size of the final application. He'll then go into detail on how Indeed has leveraged those tools to build resume instant search, covering using the closure tools in development, discussing the architecture that drives the product, and the advantages gained by using the closure tools.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][3].
